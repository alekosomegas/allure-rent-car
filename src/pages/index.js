          <h2 className='text-highlight1'>How to Rent a Car in Cyprus</h2>
          <p>
            If you are planning on exploring Cyprus, a rental car is essential. It provides the ability to travel at your own pace and convenience, and also grants access to areas of this amazing country that may otherwise be difficult to reach.
          </p>
          <h4 className='text-highlight1'>What Do You Need to Rent a Car in Cyprus?</h4>
          <p>
            To rent a car in Cyprus, you need a driver's license and a passport and you must be over 23 years old. An International driver's permit is not required. You can pay for your rental with a debit card or cash, but the deposit must be paid in advance and will be returned at the end of the rental period. If you choose to use a credit card, a hold equal to the deposit will be placed on your card until the rental is returned. The deposit amount varies depending on the car category.
